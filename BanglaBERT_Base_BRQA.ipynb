সামাজিক তাৎপর্য ছিল কেবল প্রজনন করাতেই সীমাবদ্ধ। এই লৈঙ্গিক ভূমিকা একজন নারীর প্রধান পরিচয় এবং জীবনের উদ্দেশ্যকে সংজ্ঞায়িত করত। রেনেসাঁ মানবতাবাদীদের কাছে জ্ঞানপ্রেমী হিসেবে একজন আদর্শ ও সুপরিচিত ব্যক্তি সক্রেটিস বলেছিলেন, তিনি তার প্রথম স্ত্রী জ্যান্থিপ্পেকে সহ্য করেছিলেন, কারণ তিনি তাকে পুত্র দান করেছিলেন, ঠিক যেভাবে একটি হংসীর কোলাহল সহ্য করতে হয় কারণ তা ডিম ও বাচ্চা দেয়। এই উপমাটি এই দাবিকে সমর্থন করে যে, সেইসময় একজন নারীর একমাত্র ভূমিকা ছিল প্রজনন।\\n\\nরেনেসাঁর সময় বিবাহ একজন নারীকে সংজ্ঞায়িত করত: নারী কাকে বিবাহ করছে তার উপর ভিত্তি করে তার পরিচয় তৈরি হত। একজন অবিবাহিত নারী হচ্ছে তার পিতার কাছে সম্পত্তি, আর বিবাহের পর নারী তার স্বামীর সম্পত্তি হয়ে যায়। তার স্বামীর বা পিতা কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত সুবিধাগুলো ছাড়া তার খুব সামান্য অধিকারই ছিল। বিবাহিত নারীদেরকে তাদের স্বামীদের প্রতি বাধ্য থাকতে হত, এবং তারা সতী, আজ্ঞাবহ, আনন্দপূর্ণ, নম্র, বিনয়ী এবং যদি মিষ্টভাষী না হয় তবে নীরব থাকবে এটাই আশা করা হত। উইলিয়াম শেক্সপীয়ারের ১৫৯৩ সালের নাটক দ্য টেমিং অফ দ্য শ্রু -তে ক্যাথেরিনাকে তার বুদ্ধিমত্তা ও স্পষ্টভাষিতার কারণে তার নম্র স্বভাবের বোন বিয়াংকা এর তুলনায় অবিবাহযোগ্যা হিসেবে দেখানো হয়। পেট্রুশিও তাকে 'বশে আনবার' পর দেখা যায় পেট্রুশিও যেখানে যায় তার স্ত্রী ক্যাথেরিনও অনেকটা কুকুরের মত তাকে অনুসরণ করে। ক্যাথেরিনের এই বশ্যতা প্রসংশিত হয় এবং পার্টিতে আসা জনতা তাকে 'যথাযথ নারী' হিসেবে স্বীকার করে নেয়, কেননা তখন ক্যাথেরিনা গার্হস্থ্য বিষয়গুলোর সাথে নিজেকে মানিয়ে নিয়েছে।\\n\\nএরকম পরিস্থিতিতে, এতে অবাক হওয়ার কিছু নেই যে বেশিরভাগ নারীই খুব কমই শিক্ষিত ছিল। ১৪২৪ সালে মন্টেফেল্ট্রো এর লেডি ব্যাপতিস্তা মালেতেস্তাকে পাঠানো একটি চিঠিতে, মানবতাবাদী লিওনার্দো ব্রুনি লিখেছিলেন: \"আপনি এমন এক সময়ে বাস করেন, যেখানে শিক্ষার এতদূর ক্ষয়ক্ষতি হয়েছে যে, এখানে শিক্ষিত নারী দূরের কথা, কোন শিক্ষিত পুরুষের সাথে সাক্ষাত হওয়াই কাকতালীয় ব্যাপার\"। ব্রুনী নিজে ভাবতেন যে, নারীদের শিক্ষার কোন প্রয়োজন নেই, কেননা শিক্ষার প্রয়োজন আছে এমন কোন সামাজিক আলোচনায় নারীরা নিয়োজিত নন। একই চিঠিতে তিনি লেখেন,\\n\\nকেন হাজারটা ... সূক্ষ্ম..., প্রহেলিকাময় বিষয়ের বাগ্মিতাসংক্রান্ত আলোচনাসভায় নারীদের ক্ষমতা কাজ করবে, যেখানে নারীরা কোনদিন আলোচনাসভা দেখেই নি? আলোচনাসভার বিবাদসমূহ, যেমন রণনীতি ও যুদ্ধের বিষয়গুলো পুরুষের জায়গা। কথা বলতে শেখা, কোন সাক্ষীর পক্ষে বা বিপক্ষে কথা বলা, কোন শাস্তির পক্ষে বা বিপখে কথা বলা, বা কারও খ্যাতির পক্ষে বা বিপক্ষে কথা বলা নারীর কাজ নয় ... এক কথায় তাকে এই কঠোর ও রুক্ষ আলোচনাসভাকে পুরোপুরিভাবে পুরুষের হাতে ছেড়ে দিতে হবে।\\n\\nরেনেসাঁর সময়ের বিখ্যাত বৈঠকখানাগুলোতে সেইসময় বৌদ্ধিক বিতর্ক সংঘটিত হত, কিন্তু সেইসব স্থানে নারীদেরকে স্বাগত জানানো হয়নি। গণ আলোচনাসভাগুলোতে নারীদেরকে প্রবেশাধিকার না থাকা শিক্ষিত নারীদের জন্য সমস্যার সৃষ্টি করে, এবং তা সেইসময়ে নারীদের শিক্ষাগ্রহণের সম্ভাব্যতাকেও কমিয়ে দেয়।</td>\n      <td>রেনেসার শুরুতে নারীর সামাজিক তাৎপর্য কী ছিল?</td>\n      <td>{'answer_start': [62, 62],

বিজ্ঞান অধ্যাপক লিওনার্ড ক্রাইনরক তার গবেষণাগার ইউনিভার্সিটি অফ ক্যালিফোর্নিয়া, লস অ্যাঞ্জেলেস (ইউসিএলএ) থেকে অর্পানেটের মাধ্যমে একটি বার্তা স্ট্যানফোর্ড রিসার্চ ইনস্টিটিউট (এসআরআই) তে পাঠান। নেটওয়ার্ক সরঞ্জামের দ্বিতীয় অংশ সেখানে স্থাপিত করা হয়েছিল। ১৯৬০ সালের শেষ দিকে এবং ১৯৭০ সালের প্রথম দিকে প্যাকেট সুইচিং নেটওয়ার্ক যেমন ইউকের এনপিএল, সিক্লিডিস, মেরিট নেটওয়ার্ক, টিমনেট এবং টেলেনেট এর অর্পানেটে, মার্ক I বিভিন্ন প্রোটোকল ব্যবহার করে উন্নত করা হয়। অর্পানেট বিশেষ নেতৃত্ব দেয় ইন্টারনেটওয়ার্কিং এর প্রোটোকলের উন্নয়নের জন্য, যেখানে নেটওয়ার্কসমূহের একাধিক পৃথক নেটওয়ার্ক একটি নেটওয়ার্কের সাথে যোগ করা যেতে পারে। অর্পানেটের অ্যাক্সেসের জন্য ১৯৮১ সালে একে সম্প্রসারিত করা হয়, যখন ন্যাশনাল সাইন্স ফাউন্ডেশন (এনএসএফ) কম্পিউটার সাইন্স নেটওয়ার্কের (সিএসএনএটি) উন্নয়ন করে এবং আবার ১৯৮৬ সালে যখন এনএসএফনেট মার্কিন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে গবেষণা এবং শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান থেকে সুপার কম্পিউটার সাইটগুলোতে সংযুক্ত হওয়ার সুযোগ দেয়। ১৯৮০ সালের শেষের দিকে এবং ১৯৯০ সালের শুরুর দিকে বাণিজ্যিক ইন্টারনেট সেবা প্রদানকারীরা (আইএসপির) আবির্ভাব হতে থাকে। ১৯৯০ সালে অর্পানেট কর্মবিরত করা হয়। ১৯৯৫ সালে ইন্টারনেটকে বাণিজ্যিক পণ্যে পরিণত হয়, যখন এনএসএফনেট কর্মবিরত হয়, ইন্টারনেট ব্যবহারের বাণিজ্যিক বহন শেষ নিষেধাজ্ঞা সরিয়ে ফেলা হয়।\\n১৯৯০ সালের মাঝামাঝি থেকে, ইন্টারনেট সংস্কৃতিতে ও বাণিজ্যে এবং কাছাঁকাছি-তাৎক্ষণিক যোগাযোগ যেমন, ইলেকট্রনিক মেইল, ইনস্ট্যান্ট মেসেজিং, ভয়েস ওভার ইন্টারনেট

        "We're almost ready for our post-processing function. The last bit to deal with is the impossible answer (when `squad_v2 = True`). The code above only keeps answers that are inside the context, we need to also grab the score for the impossible answer (which has start and end indices corresponding to the index of the CLS token). When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the *minimum* of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.\n",
